				<h1>Purpose</h1>
				<p class="lead">Temple Rides allows you to share rides to the temple with other Latter Day Saint members.</p>
				<p class="lead">This was created after our stake confrence, in which the stake presidency designated three areas of focus: temple, mission, and education.  We hope you will be able to use this tool to attend and help others attend the temple more frequently.  This tool is provided by invite only.  All who are invited are allowed to invite others.  Please utilize this tool only to organize rides to the temple.  I hope you will find opportunities for service, there are many elderly people who need help to get to the temple.</p>
